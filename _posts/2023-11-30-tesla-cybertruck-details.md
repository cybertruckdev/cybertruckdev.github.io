Today is the detail, we'll be updating this blog post with all the details coming from the release announcement later today.

# Cybertruck Launch Event - The Broadcast
The broadcast started with a very very slow animated video of various interior bits and parts of the Cybertruck. It's taking forever with only a background beat, no audible message at this point.

- There are 84k viewers as of 2:03pm central time.

- Cybertruck logo at the end of the video, 92.6k viewers currently 2:04pm central time.

- Looks like the video is stuck now, 2:06pm central time, just a still logo.

- 2:07pm central time, the video still sits with the logo, the music is playing, but still boring.

- 2:09pm central time, the video is still not doing anything, music has shifted.

- Refreshed the page to make sure I am not missing anything, I am not.... 2:10pm central time.

- Fell asleep, didn't miss anything, 2:11pm central time.

- Video has started showing some more animated views again, can't tell what part of the vehicle it might be yet.  

- Not even sure why I'm live blogging this, talk about a waste of time. 2:13pm central time.

- Now we're back in the interior of the truck, with it all falling apart in space... 

- We're definitely just looping the video now... 2:16pm central time.

- 2:19pm central time, we're outside the truck now, looks like we're on the moon...

- Squirrel! 2:24pm central time. You can buy a Cyber beer and Stein... https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberbeer-_-cyberstein-limited-edition-set?sku=2012814-00-A&web=true 

- Finally something happening. 2:24pm central time. "The future should look like", now we're going around the world in images and who knows what else.

- Video of the cybertruck driving around a bunch of harsh environments... 

- Towing a raptor engine...

- Looks like maybe now we're going to get started. 2:26pm central time. Elon appears to have driven out in a cybertruck

- He's got his poubty face on, and he's talking about the truck. 2:27pm central time.

- He's standing in the back of the truck, the lights can't reach him. 

- Once in a while a rare product comes around... how original. Special, unusual, special moments. So awkward. 2:28pm central time.

- It's very rare that a product comes along, that experts say is impossible.

- "Our best product, the most unique thing on the road, finally the future will look like the future" 2:29pm central time.

- Aiming for "more truck than truck, okay, thanks bro" "More utility than truck, faster than a sports car"

- Trucks are tough, how tough? Let's find out: Tesla-designed stainless steel super allow, didn't exist before

- No corrosion, doesn't need paint, body panels would break the stamping machine. Because of the steel exoskeleton, has more stiffness than a mclaren p1.

- Brings up the "broken window" incident, going to try again.

- Frans throwing a baseball, bounced off the window sill, not really throwing it very hard...

- "The glass is tough", rocks won't crack the glass, basically rockproof, makes the car very quiet. You'll appreciate how smooth and quiet it is.

- Doesn't feel like a normal truck, smooth and silent when you drive it.

- Rollover, center of gravity so low, it doesn't rollover. If you get in an argument with another car, you will win.

- Video of a tommy gun being fired at it, no penetration, windows were rolled down, didn't break.

- This is so awkward. He just brought up Joe Rogan and a bow and arrow.

- What about a truck doing actual work? 11k pound towing capacity.

- 2500lbs payload capacity, you can put more in it

- Bed 6' long 4' wide. 4x8 plywood fits with the back down

- A truck pull: A key test of how much power your truck actually has. 40k pound sled. Compared to other electric pickups, and SRW Super Duty Diesel. 

- Tri-motor 6850 curb weight

- Pulled further than other trucks, go figure.

- "Incredibly useful truck, not a grandstanding showpiece like me" 

- Performance:
