Today is the detail, we'll be updating this blog post with all the details coming from the release announcement later today.

# Cybertruck Launch Event - The Broadcast
The broadcast started with a very very slow animated video of various interior bits and parts of the Cybertruck. It's taking forever with only a background beat, no audible message at this point.

- There are 84k viewers as of 2:03pm central time.

- Cybertruck logo at the end of the video, 92.6k viewers currently 2:04pm central time.

- Looks like the video is stuck now, 2:06pm central time, just a still logo.

- 2:07pm central time, the video still sits with the logo, the music is playing, but still boring.

- 2:09pm central time, the video is still not doing anything, music has shifted.

- Refreshed the page to make sure I am not missing anything, I am not.... 2:10pm central time.

- Fell asleep, didn't miss anything, 2:11pm central time.

- Video has started showing some more animated views again, can't tell what part of the vehicle it might be yet.  

- Not even sure why I'm live blogging this, talk about a waste of time. 2:13pm central time.

- Now we're back in the interior of the truck, with it all falling apart in space... 

- We're definitely just looping the video now... 2:16pm central time.

- 2:19pm central time, we're outside the truck now, looks like we're on the moon...

- Squirrel! 2:24pm central time. You can buy a Cyber beer and Stein... https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberbeer-_-cyberstein-limited-edition-set?sku=2012814-00-A&web=true 

- Finally something happening. 2:24pm central time. "The future should look like", now we're going around the world in images and who knows what else.

- Video of the cybertruck driving around a bunch of harsh environments... 

- Towing a raptor engine...
