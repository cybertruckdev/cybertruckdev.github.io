So I got my Cybertruck order email today! Time to place the order! But, the price, oh geez. So I am looking to campaign the Cybertruck on the National SCCA Solo scene next year, but I need your help to make this dream happen! 

Can you donate something today? I am looking to raise $130,000 to cover the cost of the truck, sales tax, and the entry fees for the season!

[Donate today!](mailto:paypal@christoc.com)

If you donate $1k or more I'll let you drive it sometime with me in the passenger seat. For $10k or more I'll let you drive it by yourself. For $100k or more I'll let you drive it by yourself and I'll buy you a beer. For $1M or more I'll let you drive it by yourself, buy you a beer, and I'll let you keep the truck.
