Frans throwing a baseball, bounced off the window sill, not really throwing it very hard…     “The glass is tough”, rocks won’t crack the glass, basically rockproof, makes the car very quiet. You’ll appreciate how smooth and quiet it is.     Doesn’t feel like a normal truck, smooth and silent when you drive it.     Rollover, center of gravity so low, it doesn’t rollover. If you get in an argument with another car, you will win.     Video of a tommy gun being fired at it, no penetration, windows were rolled down, didn’t break.     This is so awkward. He just brought up Joe Rogan and a bow and arrow.     What about a truck doing actual work? 11k pound towing capacity.     2500lbs payload capacity, you can put more in it     Bed 6’ long 4’ wide. 4x8 plywood fits with the back down     A truck pull: A key test of how much power your truck actually has. 40k pound sled. Compared to other electric pickups, and SRW Super Duty Diesel.     Tri-motor 6850 curb weight     Pulled further than other trucks, go figure.     “Incredibly useful truck, not a grandstanding showpiece like me”     Performance:      35” All terrain tires   Adaptive air suspension   17” ground clearance (true, clearance, no diff hanging below)   Locking diffs   Rear torque vectoring   Steer by wire   Four Wheel Steering - variable gain   Turning circle less than a Model S   Low speed manuverability   48V low voltage architecture, first of it’s kind   Ethernet comms, distributed controllers, 70% less wire      "

    "body": "2023/08/28 - Tesla’s electric vehicles (EVs) have captured global attention, but the company’s ambitious manufacturing capabilities are equally fascinating. Often overshadowed by the final products—sleek, high-performance electric cars—the Gigafactories are the backbone of Tesla’s operation. This post aims to give you an insider’s look at these engineering marvels and their role in Tesla’s strategy. The Birth of the Gigafactory Concept: When Tesla decided to ramp up its production to meet the soaring demand for EVs, they realized that existing manufacturing capacities wouldn’t suffice. Elon Musk introduced the concept of the Gigafactory in 2014, aiming to produce batteries and vehicles on an unprecedented scale. Scale and Impact: Tesla’s first Gigafactory, located in Nevada, has a footprint of approximately 5. 3 million square feet and is still expanding. It is designed to produce up to 500,000 car battery packs per year, along with other energy products. The enormous scale is a testament to Tesla’s ambition and has been crucial in driving down the costs of batteries and EVs. Vertical Integration: One of the standout features of Tesla’s Gigafactories is the emphasis on vertical integration. Almost every component of a Tesla car, from batteries to seats, is produced in-house. This not only cuts down on logistical challenges but also ensures quality control and quicker innovation cycles. Sustainability Initiatives: Tesla’s Gigafactories are more than just manufacturing units; they’re designed to be sustainable facilities. The Nevada Gigafactory aims to operate on renewable energy entirely, thereby setting a precedent for industrial sustainability. Global Expansion: Tesla has been steadily expanding its Gigafactory network to other parts of the world, including China and Europe. The Gigafactory in Shanghai played a critical role in Tesla’s successful entry into the Chinese market, and future factories aim to replicate this success in Europe and beyond. Innovation Hub: Apart from large-scale manufacturing, Gigafactories serve as innovation hubs. The facilities allow Tesla’s engineers to work on new technologies, manufacturing methods, and production efficiencies. This culture of innovation ensures that Tesla remains at the forefront of both manufacturing and product development. Challenges and Criticisms: Managing such colossal operations is not without its challenges. Issues like labor conditions, environmental concerns, and community relations have been points of criticism against Tesla’s Gigafactories. However, the company is actively working to address these concerns as it scales its operations. Conclusion: The Gigafactories are not just impressive for their scale; they are central to Tesla’s mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. As Tesla continues to expand its global manufacturing footprint, the Gigafactories will play an increasingly important role in shaping not just the automotive landscape but also the broader push toward a more sustainable future.

    "title": "The Battery Revolution - Understanding Tesla's Advancements in Energy Storage",
    "body": "2023/08/26 - Tesla is a name synonymous with groundbreaking electric vehicles (EVs), but what often gets overshadowed is the company’s pioneering role in battery technology. While the sleek designs and autonomous driving features grab headlines, it’s Tesla’s advancements in energy storage that truly set it apart. Let’s delve into the technological breakthroughs that enable Tesla’s industry-leading range and what the future holds for battery technology. A Brief History of Tesla Batteries: When Tesla introduced the Roadster back in 2008, it was powered by thousands of small lithium-ion cells, similar to those found in laptops. This was a radical departure from the large, custom-made battery packs that were common in EVs at that time. Tesla’s innovative approach allowed for better energy density, greater range, and more flexible design options. The Lithium-Ion Paradigm: Tesla’s commitment to lithium-ion technology has been a key factor in its success. The energy density of lithium-ion batteries allows Tesla vehicles to achieve impressive ranges that often exceed 300 miles on a single charge. Moreover, lithium-ion batteries are lighter and more compact than other battery types, which contributes to the overall performance and efficiency of Tesla cars. Enter the Gigafactory: To meet its ambitious production targets and bring down the cost of batteries, Tesla established its Gigafactories. These massive facilities aim to produce enough batteries to power 500,000 vehicles annually. The scale of these operations has not only allowed Tesla to reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) but has also facilitated advancements in battery chemistry and architecture. Battery Management System (BMS): One often-overlooked aspect of Tesla’s battery innovation is its Battery Management System (BMS). The BMS is software that regulates various parameters like voltage, temperature, and charge/discharge rates. This ensures optimal performance and longevity, further setting Tesla batteries apart from the competition.

    "title": "How Tesla Revolutionized the Automotive Industry",
    "body": "2023/08/25 - Interested in a Tesla?In the annals of automotive history, few companies have ignited as much change, debate, and excitement as Tesla. Founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, and later joined by Elon Musk, Ian Wright, and JB Straubel, Tesla Inc. set out with a daring goal: to prove that electric vehicles (EVs) could be better than gasoline-powered cars. Over the years, Tesla has not only achieved this but has spurred a series of innovations that have reshaped the industry at large. Here’s a look at how Tesla has revolutionized the automotive realm: 1. Emphasis on Electric:: Tesla’s singular focus on EVs challenged the long-standing assumption that electric cars were impractical or inferior to traditional combustion engine vehicles. With the launch of the Roadster in 2008, Tesla demonstrated that EVs could be both high-performance and desirable. This shift in perception led many traditional automakers to accelerate their EV programs. 2. Direct-to-Consumer Sales Model:: Bypassing the traditional dealership system, Tesla opted for a direct sales model. Customers visit Tesla showrooms or order their cars online. This approach has given Tesla tighter control over its sales experience and branding, while also raising legal and legislative debates in various states over automotive sales laws. 3. Supercharger Network:: One of the biggest concerns with EVs has always been “range anxiety” – the fear that an electric vehicle would run out of power before reaching a charging station. Tesla’s answer was the Supercharger network, a series of high-speed charging stations that not only charge Tesla vehicles quickly but are also strategically placed to allow for long-distance travel. 4. Over-the-Air Updates:: While software updates in traditional vehicles often require a trip to the dealership, Tesla’s EVs can be updated remotely, much like a smartphone. These over-the-air updates can enhance performance, rectify issues, or even add entirely new features, ensuring that vehicles improve after they’ve been purchased. 5. Self-Driving Ambitions:: Autopilot, Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system, brought semi-autonomous driving capabilities to the mainstream. While not fully self-driving, the system incorporates features like lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control, and automated parking. Tesla’s commitment to a self-driving future has pushed other automakers to fast-track their autonomous driving programs. 6. Gigafactories and Vertical Integration:: To support its ambitious EV production targets, Tesla has invested in large-scale manufacturing plants known as Gigafactories. These massive facilities, found in locations from Nevada to Shanghai, represent Tesla’s commitment to vertical integration and aim to drive down the costs of batteries and EV production. 7. Open-Source Patents:: In 2014, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would make its electric car patents available to the public and allow others to use them in good faith. This unprecedented move was intended to foster innovation in the EV space and accelerate the global transition to sustainable transport. 8. Emphasis on Sustainability:: Tesla’s mission is not just about producing EVs, but promoting sustainable energy more broadly. Their solar products, energy storage solutions (like the Powerwall and Powerpack), and even their acquisition of SolarCity, underscore a broader vision for a sustainable energy ecosystem. Conclusion:: Tesla’s journey from an EV start-up to a major automotive powerhouse is a testament to its audacious vision and its ability to disrupt established norms. While the company has faced its share of challenges and criticisms, its impact on the automotive industry is undeniable. As major automakers pivot to electric and sustainable models, much of that momentum can be attributed to the trail that Tesla blazed. Whether one is an avid supporter or a skeptic, the Tesla story offers invaluable lessons on innovation, persistence, and the power of vision. "

    "title": "How to tell your Cybertruck Order Number Position",
    "body": "2023/08/23 - So you’ve ordered a Cybertruck, and you’re wondering how many people are ahead of you in line.  Here’s how to tell:  Go to Tesla’s Cybertruck Order Page Click on “Manage” in the upper right corner Click on “View Details” next to your Cybertruck order Click on “View Order Agreement” Search for “Order Number” in the document Your order number will be in the format RN123456789But what does that tell you? Not a whole lot without a little more info, so here you go. There’s a Cybertruck Reservation Tracker, it will provide you some info, but the value is limited because some of the data is just flat out wrong. My order for example, says it is attached to someone in Ithaca, NY and is a prior Tesla Owner. I am in Missouri, and have never owned a Tesla. That tracker shows that my order is estimated to be position 6,368, and 1,338 in line for the Trim (3 motor) that I ordered. There are also a bunch of duplicate order numbers in there with all sorts of different order dates. So trying to throw out most of their filtering logic based on the assumption that they simply don’t have the right info, let’s start with a more basic assumption. Order number 112,744,133 shows up with a “corrected” position of 9, so let’s assume that the order number is within 13-15 numbers of that actual order number, so somewhere around 112,744,120. That puts my order number around 7,080. The tracker tries to estimate out how many “other” orders (other models, not truck) were placed for Teslas in between when the initial order was placed, and my Cybertruck order was placed. I have a hard time believing that many, if any, were ordering other Teslas in the few minutes from the time the order window opened to the time that I ordered, so I would lean towards somewhere in that 7k range for my order. Now the question is how many folks will cancel their Cybertruck order? How many people have already cancelled their Cybertruck order? How many people will simply not respond when the order banks actually open up and people need to start configuring the paying for their Cybertruck? As we near the end of Q3 2023, my uneducated assumptions tell me that we will see some pricing and delivery of the Cybertruck before the end of September 2023, and from there we will see production ramp up. I am expecting to get to place my order sometime in late Spring 2024. This is all based on a lot of assumptions. My last vehicle order, a Ford F250, took 400 days from the day I ordered it to the date I picked it up, and that wasn’t a NEW model, it was just a super duty truck from Ford…. When do you think you’ll get your Cybertruck order? "
