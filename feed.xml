        <title>From Gasoline to Gigawatts- Why Switch to a Tesla?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ts.la/christopher30216&quot;&gt;Interested in a Tesla?&lt;/a&gt;
If you’re still driving that trusty old gas-powered vehicle, you might be wondering why there’s so much buzz about electric vehicles (EVs), particularly those from Tesla. Should you consider making the leap to electric? Let’s delve into the reasons why many are opting for the Tesla experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-environmental-benefits&quot;&gt;1. Environmental Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reduced-emissions&quot;&gt;Reduced Emissions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional gasoline vehicles emit a significant amount of pollutants, contributing to air pollution and climate change. Tesla vehicles, being 100% electric, have zero tailpipe emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clean-energy-transition&quot;&gt;Clean Energy Transition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If charged with renewable energy sources like wind or solar, Tesla cars operate entirely on clean energy, further reducing your carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-economic-advantages&quot;&gt;2. Economic Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lower-operating-costs&quot;&gt;Lower Operating Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity, on a per-mile basis, is generally cheaper than gasoline. Additionally, with fewer moving parts compared to traditional vehicles, EVs often have lower maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;federal-and-state-incentives&quot;&gt;Federal and State Incentives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world offer incentives to EV owners, ranging from tax credits to rebates and carpool lane access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-advanced-technology&quot;&gt;3. Advanced Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;autopilot--full-self-driving&quot;&gt;Autopilot &amp;amp; Full Self-Driving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is at the forefront of autonomous driving technology. Their advanced driver-assistance system, Autopilot, is included standard, and with additional upgrades, the potential for full self-driving becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;over-the-air-updates&quot;&gt;Over-the-Air Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla vehicles receive regular software updates over the air, bringing improvements and new features directly to the car without needing a trip to a service center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-superior-performance&quot;&gt;4. Superior Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla EVs are known for their impressive acceleration and top speeds. The instant torque provided by electric motors gives a driving experience unlike any gasoline-powered sports car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-the-supercharger-network&quot;&gt;5. The Supercharger Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s expanding Supercharger network makes long-distance travel easy. Charging stops are faster than ever, and the integrated navigation in Tesla vehicles plans the route and charging stops for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-future-proofing&quot;&gt;6. Future-Proofing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto industry is experiencing a seismic shift towards electrification. As more cities consider banning or restricting gasoline cars, owning an EV, especially from a brand as forward-thinking as Tesla, ensures you’re future-proofed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-a-holistic-experience&quot;&gt;7. A Holistic Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is more than just a car manufacturer. From their solar products to energy storage solutions, the brand is paving the way for a sustainable future. By owning a Tesla, you become part of this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>How to tell your Cybertruck Order Number Position</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you’ve ordered a Cybertruck, and you’re wondering how many people are ahead of you in line.  Here’s how to tell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck&quot;&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck Order Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on “Manage” in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on “View Details” next to your Cybertruck order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on “View Order Agreement”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search for “Order Number” in the document&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your order number will be in the format RN123456789&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does that tell you? Not a whole lot without a little more info, so here you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/tesla-reservation-tracker&quot;&gt;Cybertruck Reservation Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, it will provide you some info, but the value is limited because some of the data is just flat out wrong. My order for example, says it is attached to someone in Ithaca, NY and is a prior Tesla Owner. I am in Missouri, and have never owned a Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That tracker shows that my order is estimated to be position 6,368, and 1,338 in line for the Trim (3 motor) that I ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a bunch of duplicate order numbers in there with all sorts of different order dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So trying to throw out most of their filtering logic based on the assumption that they simply don’t have the right info, let’s start with a more basic assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Order number 112,744,133 shows up with a “corrected” position of 9, so let’s assume that the order number is within 13-15 numbers of that actual order number, so somewhere around 112,744,120. That puts my order number around 7,080.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracker tries to estimate out how many “other” orders (other models, not truck) were placed for Teslas in between when the initial order was placed, and my Cybertruck order was placed. I have a hard time believing that many, if any, were ordering other Teslas in the few minutes from the time the order window opened to the time that I ordered, so I would lean towards somewhere in that 7k range for my order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question is how many folks will cancel their Cybertruck order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people have already cancelled their Cybertruck order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people will simply not respond when the order banks actually open up and people need to start configuring the paying for their Cybertruck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we near the end of Q3 2023, my uneducated assumptions tell me that we will see some pricing and delivery of the Cybertruck before the end of September 2023, and from there we will see production ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am expecting to get to place my order sometime in late Spring 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all based on a lot of assumptions. My last vehicle order, a Ford F250, took 400 days from the day I ordered it to the date I picked it up, and that wasn’t a NEW model, it was just a super duty truck from Ford….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When do you think you’ll get your Cybertruck order?&lt;/p&gt;
