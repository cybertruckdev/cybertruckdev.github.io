        <title>Autocross a Tesla Cybertruck GoFundMe!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I got my Cybertruck order email today! Time to place the order! But, the price, oh geez. So I am looking to campaign the Cybertruck on the National SCCA Solo scene next year, but I need your help to make this dream happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you donate something today? I am looking to raise $130,000 to cover the cost of the truck, sales tax, and the entry fees for the season!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gofund.me/e25063d3&quot;&gt;Donate today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you donate $1k or more I’ll let you drive it sometime with me in the passenger seat. For $10k or more I’ll let you drive it by yourself. For $100k or more I’ll let you drive it by yourself and I’ll buy you a beer. For $1M or more I’ll let you drive it by yourself, buy you a beer, and I’ll let you keep the truck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A ChatGPT summary of the delivery event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A ChatGPT generated summary based on my notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tesla Cybertruck Launch Event, broadcasted online, began with a slow animated video showcasing various interior components of the Cybertruck. Initially, there was no audible message, only a background beat. The viewer count was 84k at 2:03 PM and rose to 92.6k by 2:04 PM. However, technical issues appeared, with the video stuck on the Cybertruck logo from 2:06 PM onwards, leading to a monotonous experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broadcast showed repetitive and unclear animations of the truck’s interior and exterior, including scenes set in space and on the moon, but lacked substantive content for a long period. This led to frustration and boredom among viewers, with the live blogger even falling asleep at one point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event became more engaging around 2:24 PM, with a new video segment showcasing the Cybertruck in various harsh environments and towing a raptor engine. Tesla CEO Elon Musk then made an appearance, driving a Cybertruck and delivering a speech. He emphasized the truck’s unique features, such as its Tesla-designed stainless steel super alloy, high durability, and innovative design elements like “rockproof” windows and a steel exoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk discussed the truck’s performance capabilities, including its towing and payload capacities, bed size, and advanced features like adaptive air suspension, 17-inch ground clearance, and steer-by-wire system. He also highlighted the Cybertruck’s superior performance in a drag race against a 2023 Porsche 911, boasting a 0-60 mph acceleration of 2.6 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event concluded with the delivery of three Cybertrucks to owners, with a line of Cybertrucks presented but without detailed information on options or pricing. Musk’s final remarks were self-deprecating, and the overall event was perceived as uneventful and lacking new information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tesla Cybertruck Details</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;cybertruck-launch-event---the-broadcast&quot;&gt;Cybertruck Launch Event - The Broadcast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcast started with a very very slow animated video of various interior bits and parts of the Cybertruck. It’s taking forever with only a background beat, no audible message at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 84k viewers as of 2:03pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybertruck logo at the end of the video, 92.6k viewers currently 2:04pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like the video is stuck now, 2:06pm central time, just a still logo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2:07pm central time, the video still sits with the logo, the music is playing, but still boring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2:09pm central time, the video is still not doing anything, music has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refreshed the page to make sure I am not missing anything, I am not…. 2:10pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fell asleep, didn’t miss anything, 2:11pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video has started showing some more animated views again, can’t tell what part of the vehicle it might be yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not even sure why I’m live blogging this, talk about a waste of time. 2:13pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re back in the interior of the truck, with it all falling apart in space…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re definitely just looping the video now… 2:16pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2:19pm central time, we’re outside the truck now, looks like we’re on the moon…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squirrel! 2:24pm central time. You can buy a Cyber beer and Stein… https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberbeer-_-cyberstein-limited-edition-set?sku=2012814-00-A&amp;amp;web=true&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally something happening. 2:24pm central time. “The future should look like”, now we’re going around the world in images and who knows what else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video of the cybertruck driving around a bunch of harsh environments…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Towing a raptor engine…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like maybe now we’re going to get started. 2:26pm central time. Elon appears to have driven out in a cybertruck&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s got his poubty face on, and he’s talking about the truck. 2:27pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s standing in the back of the truck, the lights can’t reach him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in a while a rare product comes around… how original. Special, unusual, special moments. So awkward. 2:28pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very rare that a product comes along, that experts say is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our best product, the most unique thing on the road, finally the future will look like the future” 2:29pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aiming for “more truck than truck, okay, thanks bro” “More utility than truck, faster than a sports car”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trucks are tough, how tough? Let’s find out: Tesla-designed stainless steel super allow, didn’t exist before&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No corrosion, doesn’t need paint, body panels would break the stamping machine. Because of the steel exoskeleton, has more stiffness than a mclaren p1.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brings up the “broken window” incident, going to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frans throwing a baseball, bounced off the window sill, not really throwing it very hard…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The glass is tough”, rocks won’t crack the glass, basically rockproof, makes the car very quiet. You’ll appreciate how smooth and quiet it is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t feel like a normal truck, smooth and silent when you drive it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rollover, center of gravity so low, it doesn’t rollover. If you get in an argument with another car, you will win.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video of a tommy gun being fired at it, no penetration, windows were rolled down, didn’t break.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so awkward. He just brought up Joe Rogan and a bow and arrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about a truck doing actual work? 11k pound towing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2500lbs payload capacity, you can put more in it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bed 6’ long 4’ wide. 4x8 plywood fits with the back down&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A truck pull: A key test of how much power your truck actually has. 40k pound sled. Compared to other electric pickups, and SRW Super Duty Diesel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tri-motor 6850 curb weight&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulled further than other trucks, go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Incredibly useful truck, not a grandstanding showpiece like me”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;35” All terrain tires&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Adaptive air suspension&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;17” ground clearance (true, clearance, no diff hanging below)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Locking diffs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rear torque vectoring&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Steer by wire&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Four Wheel Steering - variable gain&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turning circle less than a Model S&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Low speed manuverability&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;48V low voltage architecture, first of it’s kind&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ethernet comms, distributed controllers, 70% less wire&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drag Race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2023 Porsche 911 - pulling a porsche 911, beat a 911&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0-60 2.6s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/4 mile &amp;lt;11s&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deliveries begin now&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulled another truck in, not sure why yet&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opens the door for a lady to get in, they are handing over trucks to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 trucks so far delivered 2:44pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a whole line of cybertrucks, but no details as to what options or pricing on them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Is that it?” Elon&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Thanks for coming to the cybertruck delivery event, on we’ve got one more”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon is driving out with the last guy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial take: Pretty boring event, not sure anyone learned a single new thing…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options?
Price?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah&lt;/p&gt;
