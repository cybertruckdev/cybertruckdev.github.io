        <title>Tesla Cybertruck Details</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the detail, we’ll be updating this blog post with all the details coming from the release announcement later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cybertruck-launch-event---the-broadcast&quot;&gt;Cybertruck Launch Event - The Broadcast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcast started with a very very slow animated video of various interior bits and parts of the Cybertruck. It’s taking forever with only a background beat, no audible message at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 84k viewers as of 2:03pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybertruck logo at the end of the video, 92.6k viewers currently 2:04pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like the video is stuck now, 2:06pm central time, just a still logo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2:07pm central time, the video still sits with the logo, the music is playing, but still boring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2:09pm central time, the video is still not doing anything, music has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refreshed the page to make sure I am not missing anything, I am not…. 2:10pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fell asleep, didn’t miss anything, 2:11pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video has started showing some more animated views again, can’t tell what part of the vehicle it might be yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not even sure why I’m live blogging this, talk about a waste of time. 2:13pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re back in the interior of the truck, with it all falling apart in space…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re definitely just looping the video now… 2:16pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2:19pm central time, we’re outside the truck now, looks like we’re on the moon…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squirrel! 2:24pm central time. You can buy a Cyber beer and Stein… https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberbeer-_-cyberstein-limited-edition-set?sku=2012814-00-A&amp;amp;web=true&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally something happening. 2:24pm central time. “The future should look like”, now we’re going around the world in images and who knows what else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video of the cybertruck driving around a bunch of harsh environments…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Towing a raptor engine…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like maybe now we’re going to get started. 2:26pm central time. Elon appears to have driven out in a cybertruck&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s got his poubty face on, and he’s talking about the truck. 2:27pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s standing in the back of the truck, the lights can’t reach him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in a while a rare product comes around… how original. Special, unusual, special moments. So awkward. 2:28pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very rare that a product comes along, that experts say is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our best product, the most unique thing on the road, finally the future will look like the future” 2:29pm central time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aiming for “more truck than truck, okay, thanks bro” “More utility than truck, faster than a sports car”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How Tesla Revolutionized the Automotive Industry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Interested in a Tesla?
In the annals of automotive history, few companies have ignited as much change, debate, and excitement as Tesla. Founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, and later joined by Elon Musk, Ian Wright, and JB Straubel, Tesla Inc. set out with a daring goal: to prove that electric vehicles (EVs) could be better than gasoline-powered cars. Over the years, Tesla has not only achieved this but has spurred a series of innovations that have reshaped the industry at large. Here’s a look at how Tesla has revolutionized the automotive realm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-emphasis-on-electric&quot;&gt;1. Emphasis on Electric:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s singular focus on EVs challenged the long-standing assumption that electric cars were impractical or inferior to traditional combustion engine vehicles. With the launch of the Roadster in 2008, Tesla demonstrated that EVs could be both high-performance and desirable. This shift in perception led many traditional automakers to accelerate their EV programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-direct-to-consumer-sales-model&quot;&gt;2. Direct-to-Consumer Sales Model:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing the traditional dealership system, Tesla opted for a direct sales model. Customers visit Tesla showrooms or order their cars online. This approach has given Tesla tighter control over its sales experience and branding, while also raising legal and legislative debates in various states over automotive sales laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-supercharger-network&quot;&gt;3. Supercharger Network:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest concerns with EVs has always been “range anxiety” – the fear that an electric vehicle would run out of power before reaching a charging station. Tesla’s answer was the Supercharger network, a series of high-speed charging stations that not only charge Tesla vehicles quickly but are also strategically placed to allow for long-distance travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-over-the-air-updates&quot;&gt;4. Over-the-Air Updates:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While software updates in traditional vehicles often require a trip to the dealership, Tesla’s EVs can be updated remotely, much like a smartphone.

        <title>How to tell your Cybertruck Order Number Position</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you’ve ordered a Cybertruck, and you’re wondering how many people are ahead of you in line.  Here’s how to tell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck&quot;&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck Order Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on “Manage” in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on “View Details” next to your Cybertruck order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on “View Order Agreement”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search for “Order Number” in the document&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your order number will be in the format RN123456789&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does that tell you? Not a whole lot without a little more info, so here you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/tesla-reservation-tracker&quot;&gt;Cybertruck Reservation Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, it will provide you some info, but the value is limited because some of the data is just flat out wrong. My order for example, says it is attached to someone in Ithaca, NY and is a prior Tesla Owner. I am in Missouri, and have never owned a Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That tracker shows that my order is estimated to be position 6,368, and 1,338 in line for the Trim (3 motor) that I ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a bunch of duplicate order numbers in there with all sorts of different order dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So trying to throw out most of their filtering logic based on the assumption that they simply don’t have the right info, let’s start with a more basic assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Order number 112,744,133 shows up with a “corrected” position of 9, so let’s assume that the order number is within 13-15 numbers of that actual order number, so somewhere around 112,744,120. That puts my order number around 7,080.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracker tries to estimate out how many “other” orders (other models, not truck) were placed for Teslas in between when the initial order was placed, and my Cybertruck order was placed. I have a hard time believing that many, if any, were ordering other Teslas in the few minutes from the time the order window opened to the time that I ordered, so I would lean towards somewhere in that 7k range for my order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question is how many folks will cancel their Cybertruck order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people have already cancelled their Cybertruck order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people will simply not respond when the order banks actually open up and people need to start configuring the paying for their Cybertruck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we near the end of Q3 2023, my uneducated assumptions tell me that we will see some pricing and delivery of the Cybertruck before the end of September 2023, and from there we will see production ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am expecting to get to place my order sometime in late Spring 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all based on a lot of assumptions. My last vehicle order, a Ford F250, took 400 days from the day I ordered it to the date I picked it up, and that wasn’t a NEW model, it was just a super duty truck from Ford….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When do you think you’ll get your Cybertruck order?&lt;/p&gt;
